# Image segmentation algo

[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

> Part of trees/ungp.



## pspnet 

Note that `src/pspnet` is a clone of [mitmul/chainer-pspnet](https://github.com/mitmul/chainer-pspnet).
Algorithmia build seems not to support git submodules (tried to update `bin/build` with no luck..).
As such, work-around is to just clone the repo as-is.
